    <p>tron is a mistake but its a good mistake to make</p>
</div><div class="quote">
    <p>Mechatronics was not a mistake</p>
</div><div class="quote">
    <p>One issue is that due to the job market/compensation, many people in the class tend to lean towards software. As someone on the mechancial side this really leaves a handful of people I can speak mech with. Overall it seems like I'm in the wrong program in this sense. Mechatronics feels like it's more ECE than ME.</p>
</div><div class="quote">
    <p>I think it's a poorly designed program that has to potential to be good but not in a good state right now. There are a ton of useless courses if someone is trying to go into robotics. They should make 3 separate streams after 2B where we can pick a cluster of courses to specialize in (similar to how EngSci at UofT does it).</p>
</div><div class="quote">
    <p>Breadth of program is a double-edged sword. If you know what you're interested in doing, it would be good to transfer into a program that better matches</p>
</div><div class="quote">
    <p>I wish I learned less about mechanical stuff</p>

        <div class="quote">
    <p>profs are there to help you (well most of them) and having friends in class goes long way (as in assignments studying for exams etc)</p>

    <p>Make memories with those you care about, and prepare in advance if you want things to be easier for future you.</p>
</div><div class="quote">
    <p>University is a very unique point in your life where a lot of your friends are in a very close proximity to you and you can do a lot of things if you want. Enjoy your time, go out and try things, and if you're ever feeling down don't hesitate to reach out to your friends and network cuz they're more willing to help you out more than you think.</p>
