        3-5% of respondents didn't do a co-op placement between terms 3 and 6. The University reduced the minimum required co-op terms required to graduate from five to four, and then further to three because of COVID.

        This interesting trend continues from the 2020 class profile where students who had the lowest cumulative grades had the highest pay for the first work term. The trend reverses by the fifth and sixth co-op and there's a weak positive relationship between grades and pay.

        Since people had co-ops where they performed more than one type of work, the salary for those positions are included in all the different types of work that they did. Therefore, if someone made $35/hour doing firmware and hardware work, the averages for both firmware and electrical include an entry for $35

        This is a crude multiple regression to find what effect different types of work has on salary. Take these data with a grain of salt, but positive numbers mean that it generally increased your salary compared to the average if you were doing that kind of work, and negative numbers means it decreased your salary to do that kind of work. Overall, Robotics, ML/AI and Product Management were typically associated with higher salaries. The fifth co-op term weird things happened where some trends reversed

        Generally, people liked their co-ops more as the terms went on. This is probably a combination of having the requisite experience to get the roles that people were looking for, as well as people figuring out what they like and what they do not

        Most people didn't end up going to California for co-ops, probably due to the pandemic disrupting the terms where most people usually go to California. The University actually did not allow work outside of Canada to count as a credit at the beginning of the pandemic, which might have influenced people's decisions along with the public health situation. Remote work sprung out of nowhere due to the pandemic too
